A big thanks to all FlightGear developers, especially those of the 737-800YV, 787, A320, and MD-11. Your work has been crucial to the progress of this aircraft and FlightGear in general. Thanks for your efforts and dedication!

## Installation Instructions - Download
- Download and unzip this folder in your aircraft folder. Make sure FlightGear is pointed to that folder; if not, you can tell it to do so in the Add-ons menu.
- Make sure to remove the '-main' from the end of the folder, or it won't work.
- The aircraft should now show up in the launcher.

## Installation Instructions - Git
- Open the Git Bash terminal, and make sure you are in your aircraft directory.
- Enter `git clone https://github.com/sriemmanuel787/737-MAX.git` into the terminal.
- The aircraft should now show up in the launcher.

*Progress is underway!* If you have any questions, feel free to email me at sriemmanuel787@outlook.com or contact me on the FG Discord with the usename 'spoilerlogic' Thanks!
